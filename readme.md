# Sail reinstall

Laravel Sail is a great starting point for getting a Laravel development environment up and running. There is only a minor issue when you are working on a existing application that uses
Laravel Sail, you will need to install both PHP and composer locally. 

Using the following script you will not need to have either PHP or composer installed locally.

All credits etc. goes to Taylor Otwell the creator of Laravel
